"""Session-scoped fixtures for jig_cli tests.

Builds the test workspace once per session so that interface YAML files
are installed and discoverable via AMENT_PREFIX_PATH.

The jig package source is copied into the test workspace at build time
so tests always build against the current jig source without requiring
the outer workspace to be built first.

"""Dagger CI module for the jig repo.

Exposes a single function:

- ``build-and-test`` — colcon build + test inside a ROS 2 base container,
                       parameterised by ROS distro (humble/jazzy/kilted).

Linting (pre-commit) is intentionally not handled here: it runs locally
via the git pre-commit hook and in GitHub Actions directly, which has
better caching for pre-commit environments than we'd get by shelling
out through Dagger.

Call locally from the repo root::

    dagger call build-and-test --src=. --ros-distro=jazzy

def sh(*cmds: str) -> list[str]:
    """Wrap a sequence of shell commands as an argv for ``with_exec``.

    Dagger's ``with_exec`` takes a raw argv, so any step that needs shell
    features (``source``, ``&&``, globs, env expansion) has to go through
    ``bash -c "..."``. This helper keeps that boilerplate in one place:
    callers pass commands as separate strings and we stitch them into a
    single script.

    The script is prefixed with ``set -ex``:

    - ``-e`` aborts on the first non-zero exit, so a failing ``apt-get
      update`` halts the step instead of limping on to a misleading error
      three commands later.
    - ``-x`` echoes each command before running it, which makes CI logs
      self-describing when something goes wrong.

    ``-u`` (error on unset variables) is deliberately *not* set: ROS's
    ``setup.bash`` references ``AMENT_TRACE_SETUP_FILES`` without a
    default and explodes under ``-u``.

    Commands are joined with newlines rather than ``&&``. With ``-e`` in
    effect the two are equivalent for error propagation, but newlines
    avoid doubling up on failure handling and make the ``-x`` trace
    render one command per line instead of a single ``a && b && c`` blob.

        """Build the jig workspace with colcon and run its tests.

        Two-stage pipeline:

        1. **rosdep stage** — only the ``package.xml`` files are mounted
           into the container before ``rosdep install`` runs. apt/rosdep
           resolution is the single most expensive step in a cold build
           (tens of seconds pulling indices + installing system deps), and
           its only real inputs are the ``<depend>`` entries in the
           package manifests. Mounting just the manifests means editing
           any ``.cpp``/``.py``/``CMakeLists.txt`` leaves this layer as a
           cache hit via Dagger's input-hashed per-op cache.

        2. **workspace-wide colcon build + test**, with persistent
           ``CacheVolume`` mounts for ``build/``, ``install/``, ``log/``
           and ccache. Colcon's own incremental machinery (mtime-based
           per-package skip, CMake reconfiguration only where needed)
           decides what to rebuild; ccache covers object-file reuse even
           when CMake does reconfigure or when Dagger's layer cache is
           cold. The cache keys are per-ROS-distro so a humble ``build/``
           never leaks into a jazzy run.

           Trade-off vs. per-package Dagger layers: ``CacheVolume`` is
           mutable shared state, not content-addressed, so a poisoned
           ``build/`` can persist across runs. If that happens, bump the
           cache key suffix or purge the volume. In exchange, adding a
           workspace package requires no changes to this function's
           build loop, and cold-Dagger-cache runs (new branch, cleared
           engine) get a big speedup from ccache that layer caching
           cannot provide.
